I bring a rich blend of academic and industrial experience to the computer vision, deep learning, and privacy preservation domain. I am a senior member of IEEE along with an Associate Investigator at CONNECT Centre and Academic Collaborator at ADAPT Centre, Ireland. My educational journey began with a Ph.D. in Industrial and Information Systems Engineering from [Hankuk University of Foreign Studies](https://www.hufs.ac.kr/hufs/index.do#link)in Yongin, Republic of Korea, where I focused on Ambient Intelligence and Affective Computing Methods using Machine Learning, Wearable Sensors, and Imaging techniques under the guidance of [Prof. Seok-Lyong Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OPcK7J0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I further honed my skills with a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at [Tech University of Korea](https://www.tukorea.ac.kr/en/index.do#none) under the guidance of [Prof. Ik Hyun Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nxxe9zEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I am currently associated with Technological University Dublin [TU Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/) as a faculty member. I have previously served as an Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, and Lecturer (from 2011 - 2023) at University of Sindh, Pakistan. I have the experience of working with multinational companies as a Network and RF Engineer from 2008 to 2011. I have published more than 70 research articles in national, international journals, and conference proceedings. I am the runner-up recipient for UG2+ Competition (Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation) at CVPR2022 and second runner-up for UG2+ Competition (Target Coded Restoration Challenge) at CVPR 2023. Furthermore, I have achieved Top ten positions in several of the CVPR challenges from 2022 to 2024. I am currently serving as an Associate Editor for PLoS ONE and Consumer Electronics Letters. In addition, I am serving(ed) as a Guest Editor for special issues in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networks, IEEE Open Journal of the Communication Society, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, Computers and Electrical Engineering, Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, Journal of King Saud University: Computer and Information Sciences, and Sustainable Energy Technology and Assessments. I have also served as a TPC member for main tracks and workshops in A* Conferences, such as ECAI, Globecom, Mobicom, and ICDCS. I am a Regular Reviewer of notable journals, including IEEE Transactions, IEEE Journals, Elsevier Journals, and Springer Journals.

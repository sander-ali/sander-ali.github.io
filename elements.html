								<p>The atmospheric turbulence mitigation challenge at CVPR 2022 is a part of the Workshop on UG2+ Prize Challenge. The challenge addresses the problem of images acquired over long distances through atmospheric turbulences. It is a challenging task as there is no image domain model and no realistic way of acquiring input-output pairs without using wave-propagation simulation. Our team secured 2nd position in the competition</p>

								</h2></a>
								<p>The challenge provides LDV 2.0 dataset for performing superresolution on compressed video frames. We proposed the Residual Denoising and Feedback Networks (RDFDBK-Net) for solving the challenge. Our team was listed in Top-12 results. The method was highlighted in a paper published at CVPR workshops 2022. </p>

								<a href="https://github.com/sander-ali/DCGAN_motorbikes "><h2>Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks</h2></a>
								<p>DCGAN uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the generator and discriminator, respectively. It was proposed by Radford et. al. in the paper Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. The repository provides the code to create varied images of motorbikes from caltech 101 dataset.</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/sander-ali/custom-Environment-for-Reinforcement-Learning"><h2>Custom Environment for Reinforcement Learning</h2></a>
								<p>The repository provides a simple Q-learning implementation for custom environment. There is one hunter and one tiger. The scenario is simple, Tiger has to fetch the meat and run without getting caught. For further simplicity, the hunter remains still. You can change the parameters accordingly but due to crude coding, qtable consumes a lot of memory and space so I have just trained it for 1000 episodes and show the results at every 10th step. You can vary the Grid size as well.</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/sander-ali/denoising_sae"><h2>Image Denoising using Stacked Autoencoders</h2></a>
								<p>Currently, many software and apps have been introduced that reduce noise from images. However, one can train and build their own machine learning model for denoising images. One of the ways to effectively reduce noise from images is the use of stacked autoencoders. A simple implementation of denoising stacked autoencoders is provided in the aforementioned repository</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/sander-ali/Transposed_Convolutional_Networks"><h2>Transposed Convolutional Networks</h2></a>
								<p>Transposed convolutional neural networks were designed to upsample the images using learnable parameters. The repository provides an implementation for the transposed convolutional neural networks based on the computations of paper "Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation" published at CVPR 2015. The implementation is based on tensorflow and caltech dataset. </p>

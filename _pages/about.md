I bring a rich blend of academic and industrial experience to the computer vision, deep learning, and privacy preservation domain. I am a senior member of IEEE along with an Associate Investigator at CONNECT Centre and Academic Collaborator at ADAPT Centre, Ireland. My educational journey began with a Ph.D. in Industrial and Information Systems Engineering from Hankuk University of Foreign Studiesin Yongin, Republic of Korea, where I focused on Ambient Intelligence and Affective Computing Methods using Machine Learning, Wearable Sensors, and Imaging techniques under the guidance of Prof. Seok-Lyong Lee. I further honed my skills with a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at Tech University of Korea under the guidance of Prof. Ik Hyun Lee.

I am currently associated with Dublin City University as an Assistant Professor. Formerly, I worked with Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin) as an Assistant Lecturer from Dec 2023 to Dec 2024. I have previously served as an Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, and Lecturer (from 2011 - 2023) at University of Sindh, Pakistan. I have the experience of working with multinational companies as a Network and RF Engineer from 2008 to 2011.

Furthermore, I have achieved Top ten positions in several of the CVPR challenges from 2022 to 2024. I am currently serving as an Associate Editor for PLoS ONE and Consumer Electronics Letters.

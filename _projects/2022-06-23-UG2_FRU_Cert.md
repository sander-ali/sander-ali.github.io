Glad to share that I have secured Runner Up Position at one of the CVPR (IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) 2022 Challenges (Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation).

The competition is a rigorous process that demands working under deadlines (one day for testing that includes downloading the data in GBs, preprocessing, applying the method, and then uploading the results). Furthermore, it requires code to be re-usable and re-producible for the organizers to test it with their own computing platforms. Lastly, the competition requires the method to be novel. This recognition is unmatchable in many ways.

I had an excellent opportunity to inspire young minds at #elementary school in #Denver, part of Denver Public Schools, #Colorado.

Sharing my passion for #robotics with curious and energetic students was truly rewarding. Seeing their excitement and questions reminded me of the importance of sparking interest in #STEM early.

I am grateful for this experience and excited for the future innovators. Looking forward to more opportunities to connect technology with education. ðŸ¤–

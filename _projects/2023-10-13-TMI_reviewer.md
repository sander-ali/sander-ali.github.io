I am delighted to share that I have been bestowed with IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI) Distinguished Reviewer (Bronze Level) for the year 2022 - 2023. 

Second time in a row. Its these little efforts from journals that motivate the reviewers to perform the honorary task (reviewing manuscript) with utmost commitment.

I recently had the privilege of leading a webinar session on "Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies" at Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (SZABIST), Gharo Campus, Karachi, Pakistan. The session focused on exploring the current landscape of AI technologies and their transformative impact across various industries.

The webinar covered key aspects of artificial intelligence, including recent developments, practical applications, and the future trajectory of AI-driven innovations. We engaged in meaningful discussions about how emerging technologies are reshaping different sectors and creating new opportunities for innovation.

The presentation slides from this session are available [Download presentation slides](/assets/pdf/SZABIST_Webinar_Slides.pdf) for those interested in diving deeper into the topics discussed. These materials provide additional insights into the concepts and examples shared during the webinar.

I extend my sincere gratitude to SZABIST Gharo Campus for organizing this enlightening session. The enthusiastic participation and thought-provoking questions from the attendees made this a truly engaging experience.

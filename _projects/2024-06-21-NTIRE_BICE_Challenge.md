I am excited to share that my submission has been included in the top methods for NTIRE 2024 Blind Compressed Image Enhancement Challenge held at CVPR competitions. This is the third consecutive year that I have been included in top methods for NTIRE challenges. I am also a co-author in the challenge report being published in CVPR workshop proceedings. Brief details regarding the method titled "Progressive Residual Dense Attention Block (RDAB)" are available in the challenge report, which can be accessed at [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024W/NTIRE/papers/Yang_NTIRE_2024_Challenge_on_Blind_Enhancement_of_Compressed_Image_Methods_CVPRW_2024_paper.pdf)

I have also made the pre-trained models and the testing code available on my GitHub page, along with the pre-trained models and the testing codes for previous competitions, i.e. https://www.github.com/sander-ali
Hope to get included in future NTIRE and other CVPR competitions as well.

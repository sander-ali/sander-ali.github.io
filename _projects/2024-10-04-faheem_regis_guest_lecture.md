During this informative session, Faheem shared deep insights into the complexities of managing high-performance ad tech infrastructure. His presentation delved into several crucial aspects of modern advertising technology platforms. Notably, he discussed the impressive achievement of maintaining sub-100ms latency while processing over 4 million requests per second, demonstrating the scale and efficiency of their systems. 


Faheem elaborated on various scaling strategies essential for handling high-volume traffic and detailed the infrastructure optimization techniques that make such performance possible. Through real-world examples and case studies, he illustrated the challenges faced in the ad tech industry and the innovative solutions implemented to overcome them.


The Anderson College of Business and Computing community greatly benefited from Faheem's expertise and real-world experiences in building and maintaining large-scale advertising technology systems. His practical insights into system architecture and performance optimization provided invaluable knowledge for our students.


We extend our sincere thanks to Faheem Memon for sharing his valuable knowledge and contributing to our students' understanding of modern ad tech infrastructure challenges and solutions. His presentation exemplified the practical application of theoretical concepts in real-world technology platforms.

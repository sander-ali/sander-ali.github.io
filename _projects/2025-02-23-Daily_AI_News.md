<h1> 🚀Ghibli Meets Interstellar With ChatGPT's New Model  </h1>

Witness the fusion of Studio Ghibli's enchanting style with the cosmic grandeur of "Interstellar," all brought to life by the power of Generative AI!

Let's use this opportunity to dive into some core techniques and applications that make this level of art possible:

1️⃣Automated Inbetweening: AI tools can generate intermediate frames between key poses, ensuring smooth transitions and reducing manual labor. This process, known as inbetweening, is crucial for achieving fluid animations.

2️⃣Deep Learning for Realism: Deep learning algorithms analyze vast datasets to generate realistic character movements and environments. Techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can create lifelike textures and backgrounds.

3️⃣Procedural Animation: AI can simulate realistic physics and crowd behavior, allowing for dynamic and immersive animations. This method automates the creation of complex scenes based on predefined rules. 

How do you think the integration of AI in animation will impact the future of storytelling?

<h1> Love to see what the community is building with Gemini 2.5 Pro! </h1>

Love to see what the community is building with Gemini 2.5 Pro! Gemini playing Pokemon on twitchTV. The stream showcases an early prototype of an Agent that plays Pokemon created by someone from community! 🤗

The Game Loop: 

1. Capture a screenshot and retrieve game status data

2. Process the image with a grid overlay to help with spatial reasoning

3. Send the screenshot and game information to the AI model

4. Parse the AI's response to determine which button to press

5. Execute the button press and wait for the game to update

6. Repeat the process for the next frame

Tools

1. Game Interface: The code connects to an mGBA emulator running Pokémon Blue via a socket connection, allowing it to:

2. Take screenshots of the current game state

3. Send button press commands (A, B, Up, Down, etc.)

4. Retrieve game status data like player position, Pokémon party info, and map details

5. AI Vision & Decision Making: The system processes game screenshots with a grid overlay and sends them to Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro (via OpenRouter), which analyzes the visual information and decides which button to press next

<h1> Big AI News from Google </h1>

Google just open-sourced SpeciesNet, an AI model built to identify wildlife from camera trap images‚Äîsupercharging conservation efforts worldwide. 

Why this matters: 

->Trained on 65M+ images from researchers across the globe

-> Recognizes 2,000+ species + key environmental markers

-> Powers Wildlife Insights, making biodiversity research scalable

-> Fully open-source (Apache 2.0)‚Äîready for devs & conservationists

This is AI for good in action.

<h1> Super Mario is the New AI Benchmark üéÆ</h1>

Researchers at Hao AI Lab (University of California) put leading language models to the test‚Äîby making them play Super Mario Bros..

Using the GamingAgent framework, AI models received basic instructions and processed the game frame by frame. According to Hao, the challenge forced AI to plan complex maneuvers and develop strategies to progress.

üèÜ Top performer? Claude 3.7 Sonnet

üíÄ Biggest struggle? Reasoning-heavy models like o1

Even OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy weighed in, calling this a "crisis in AI evaluation"‚Äîadmitting that he‚Äôs unsure which benchmark truly measures an AI model‚Äôs capabilities today.

Is gaming the future of AI benchmarking? ü§î

<h1> Pioneers of Reinforcement Learning Win the 2024 ACM Turing Award! </h1>

The "Nobel Prize of Computing" has been awarded to Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto for their groundbreaking contributions to Reinforcement Learning (RL)‚Äîa field that has revolutionized artificial intelligence.

Their work laid the foundation for many of the AI systems we see today, from AlphaGo‚Äôs historic victory over human Go champions to advancements in robotics, self-driving cars, and OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. 

Their research in temporal difference learning, policy optimization, and reward-driven behavior has shaped the way machines learn from experience.
This award is a recognition of decades of innovation that continue to inspire researchers, engineers, and AI enthusiasts worldwide.

Thank you, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, for your dedication and contributions to AI! Your work has not only advanced technology but has also inspired generations of researchers, engineers, and innovators.

<h1> WILD: OpenAI wants $20,000/month for PhD-level AI Agents üò≥ </h1>

Sounds crazy? Because it is.

The Information just reported that OpenAI executives have told some investors it planned to sell its AI agents ranging $2-20k/month.

Here's the breakdown:

- $2,000/month: Basic agents for "high-income knowledge workers."
- $10,000/month: Mid-level agents tailored for software development.
- $20,000/month: Elite, PhD-level research agents.

This means either of two things.

OpenAI's upcoming agents, like the SWE agent, are really, really good that they can easily replace top-tier talent overnight. Otherwise, why charge these prices?

OR

OpenAI has truly mastered sales psychology. $2k-$20k per month isn't priced for value delivery - you can get a top-level PhD researcher for less than that and equip them with OpenAI Pro, Claude, Grok, or any other AI tool.

It's priced to make executives feel they're buying something exclusive and transformative.

So they could brag about it, and be the "first" or "AI-powered", or even use it as an excuse to lay off some employees.

Either way, it's not AGI - it's probably just luxury branding.

<h1> Qwen beats DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI 01-mini </h1>

Today, we release QwQ-32B, our new reasoning model with only 32 billion parameters that rivals cutting-edge reasoning model, e.g., DeepSeek-R1.

Blog: https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwq-32b/

HF: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B

ModelScope: https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/QwQ-32B

Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Demo

Qwen Chat: https://chat.qwen.ai

This time, we investigate recipes for scaling RL and have achieved some impressive results based on our Qwen2.5-32B. We find that RL training con continuously improve the performance especially in math and coding, and we observe that the continous scaling of RL can help a medium-size model achieve competitieve performance against gigantic MoE model. Feel free to chat with our new models and provide us feedback!

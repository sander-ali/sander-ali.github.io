<h1> Google Gemini 2.0 Flash can play Super Mario </h1>

Playing Pokemon with LLMs became a benchmark, but what about Super Mario? Turns out Google DeepMind Gemini 2.0 Flash can play Super Mario in real-time due to its fast latency, multimodal input and long context! 🎮

Gemini 2.0 Flash receives screenshots of the game and then generates Python code (PyAutoGUI commands) for each screenshot to control the game for a short period (the next 1 or 2 seconds). Add a while loop to it and you have it play in real-time. 🤯

Hao AI Lab built Gaming agents to run platformers and puzzle video games in real time: https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent

In addition to Super Mario Bros, it also support 2048 and Tetris. With more games to come.

<h1> OpenAI's GPT-4.5 Launch Summary </h1>

🔷️ GPT-4.5 pushes pre-training further, making it significantly more powerful than GPT-4o.

🔷️ A highly capable agentic model with impressive speed—outperforms the "o-line" approach.

🔷️ Strong competitor to Sonnet 3.7.

🔷️ Combines reasoning, speed, performance, and cost-efficiency, positioning it as the top choice.

🔷️ Likely to be priced at around 50% of Claude’s cost by OpenAI.

TL;DR: This is probably the best base model available, with a strong emphasis on tool use. The only question is when it will be widely accessible.

<h1> Claude Code </h1>

🚀 The AI Coding Revolution Has Begun – Are You Keeping Up?

Anthropic just dropped Claude Code, an official AI coding agent that’s set to transform how we write software. If you’re serious about AI development, this is a game-changer.

💡 Imagine having an AI that thinks, adapts, and writes code directly in your terminal—no VS Code required. That’s exactly what Claude Code brings to the table.

⚡ I’ve been hands-on with AI agents like Claude + Cursor, and trust me, this tech is next level. It’s not just about autocompleting lines of code anymore - it’s about AI driving the entire development process.

But here’s the problem: AI is evolving at an insane speed. You blink, and you’ll miss the latest breakthroughs! That’s why I’ve put together my newsletter on the most cutting-edge tools, strategies, and real-world applications of AI agents.

📌 Inside today's issue:

✅ No-code AI agent creation (yes, you can build a planner agent even without writing a single line of code!)

✅ AI-powered automation that will 10X your productivity

✅ LangGraph, Claude Code, and the future of AI-assisted development

✅ Best practices for integrating AI into your workflow right now

Stay ahead, master the tools, and build software smarter. Small companies that use AI agents will outperform large teams who don't.

<h1> Groovy from Gradio </h1>

Announcement from Gradio

This is BIG! 🚀 We Are Bridging The Language Gap: JavaScript Speed in Python Environments!

Every developer knows the challenge: You want Python's simplicity AND JavaScript's client-side performance.

Introducing Groovy from Gradio - a focused Python-to-JavaScript transpiler that delivers exactly that:

✅ Write functions in familiar Python syntax

✅ Run them with JavaScript's client-side speed ⚡

✅ Receive clear error messages when code can't be transpiled

We are NOT attempting to replace JavaScript - Groovy prioritizes transparency over complete language coverage, making it a practical tool rather than a theoretical exercise.

For teams building with Gradio, this means maintaining one codebase while achieving the performance benefits of client-side execution.

Who else is excited about tools that reduce context-switching in development workflows?

<h1> Microsoft Unveils Dragon Copilot </h1>

🚨 BREAKING: Microsoft Unveils Dragon Copilot—The First AI Assistant for Clinical Workflows

No one becomes a doctor to do paperwork.

Yet, clinicians spend nearly 2 hours on administrative tasks for every 1 hour with patients. That’s valuable time lost—time that should be spent on care, not clicks.

Introducing Microsoft Dragon Copilot—the industry’s first AI assistant for clinical workflows that automates documentation, surfaces insights, and streamlines tasks, so clinicians can focus on what truly matters: their patients.

🔹 5 minutes saved per patient encounter

🔹 70% of clinicians feel less burnout

🔹 93% of patients report a better experience

By combining Dragon Medical One (DMO) & DAX Copilot, Microsoft is bringing the power of voice AI and generative AI into one seamless, secure solution for healthcare.

Launching in the U.S. & Canada in May, with global expansion to follow.

AI isn’t replacing clinicians—it’s giving them back their time.

<h1> Quick demo to build and deploy a powerful Research Agent in the cloud  </h1>

In the video by Armand Ruiz, he walks through the steps using the CLI - no complex setup required.

1/ Start from a ready-made template (like CrewAI or LangGraph)

2/ Customize with your watsonx inference credentials

3/ Deploy to the cloud with one command

4/ Instantly interact with your agent via a web-based chat UI

5/ Use it to retrieve and summarize content like research papers from arXiv in real time

Whether you're exploring internal automation or building intelligent assistants, this shows just how fast you can go from idea to working agent.

üîó Try it yourself: install the CLI with pip install, grab a template, and launch your agent today. Linkn to documentation and step-by-step instructions:

<h1> Google made the most powerful model free üî• </h1>

You can now build anything (e.g. a CRM):


You can literally use the world's best AI model and one-shot web apps.

All you need is a free Google account:


1Ô∏è‚É£ Select 2.5 Pro (experimental) from the list

In the Gemini App (or web interface), select the 2.5 Pro model on the top.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Activate the Canvas option at the bottom (advanced)

Below the text field, you can turn on "Canvas".

It allows Gemini to preview the code so you don't have to set up your own dev environnement.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Send your prompt and enjoy

Example prompt you can reuse:

"Develop a fully functional customer relationship management (CRM) web application tailored for a mid-sized healthcare provider. The application should streamline patient communication, appointment scheduling, record management, and billing processes.

As a team of experienced full-stack web developers specializing in healthcare technology solutions, you will design and build this application. The application should feature a user-friendly interface with distinct dashboards for administrators, doctors, and staff.

Include functionalities such as patient profiles with medical history, a messaging system, insurance verification, and report generation on key performance indicators like patient acquisition and appointment adherence. 

The front-end should be built using React. Maintain a professional, solution-oriented, and technically precise tone throughout the development process."


Of course, feel free to modify the prompt to suit your own needs.

<h1>  Voice AI just got scary good üò≥ </h1>

Imagine this:

You tell an AI to order dinner.

It calls your favorite restaurant.

Places the order.

Confirms pickup.

All on its own.

No humans needed.

That's exactly what people are building today using Llama 3 + Vapi.

Generative voice AI is here, and it‚Äôs wild.

120,000+ developers already building real-time, human-like voice agents.

‚úÖ No awkward pauses.

‚úÖ No robotic scripts.

‚úÖ Conversations that feel natural.

And it‚Äôs only getting better.

Why is Vapi leading the charge?

‚Ü≥ Integrates with ANY model, ANY API, ANY system.

‚Ü≥ Handles MILLIONS of calls with sub-500ms latency.

‚Ü≥ Trusted by startups and Fortune 500 companies alike.

Fun Fact: VAPI stands for Voice API. Simple name, powerful impact üëè

Voice AI is now at a tipping point.

The question isn't IF you'll use it, but HOW.

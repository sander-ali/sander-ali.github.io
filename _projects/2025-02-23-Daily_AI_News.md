<h1> 25th February 2025 </h1>

<h1> News 1 </h1>

🚀 Breaking: Perplexity is launching Comet, an agentic browser for the future of AI-driven research.

A major leap in AI-assisted browsing, Comet is designed to take on deep research and complex tasks—so users can focus on insights, not just searches.

What is an agentic browser?

🌐It doesn’t just retrieve links—it actively researches, synthesizes, and generates answers.
🌐It can autonomously complete multi-step tasks, like comparing sources or summarizing trends.
🌐It makes browsing more interactive and goal-driven, helping users get to decisions faster.

This is an ambitious engineering challenge, and Perplexity is inviting early adopters to join the waitlist!

The Ultra-Scale Playbook: Training LLMs on GPU Clusters

Hugging Face has published a free, open-source manual that provides detailed instructions for efficiently training large AI models.

"The largest factor for democratizing AI will always be teaching everyone how to build AI and in particular how to create, train and fine-tune high performance models." - Thomas Wolf, co-founder and CSO of Hugging Face

<h1> News 3 from Shanghai AI Laboratory </h1>

With test-time scaling, SLMs can beat large language models in reasoning tasks (BDTechTalks, February 2025)

"A new study by Shanghai AI Laboratory shows that with the test-time scaling (TTS) techniques, an SLM with 1 billion parameters can outperform a 405B LLM on the complex MATH and AIME benchmarks.

Test-time scaling (TTS) is the process of giving LLMs extra compute cylces during inference to improve their performance on various tasks. Leading reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, use “internal TTS,” which means they are trained to “think” slowly by generating a long string of chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens.

The study focuses on “external TTS,” where model reasoning is enhanced with outside help from process reward models (PRMs) and advanced search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), beam search, and “diverse verifier tree search” (DVTS). External TTS is suitable for repurposing existing models for reasoning tasks without further fine-tuning them.

Models such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o3 use “internal TTS,” where the model is trained to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences instead of using external tools.

There are various TTS strategies and choosing the best one depends on the specifics of your model and your problem."

<h1> News 4 A Phone Call Between Two AI Agents </h1>

Impressive. Two AI agents on a phone call realize they’re both AI and instantly switch to encoded audio signal communication.

They use a data-over-sound library called "ggwave" to send messages faster than speech.

The project won 1st place in a hackathon.

🎯 Evaluates single-turn, multi-turn, error handling, and context management using Tool Selection Quality (TSQ)

🎲 TSQ measures if models choose the right tools, use correct parameters, and know when NOT to use tools at all, evaluated with LLM as a Judge

📊 Uses datasets from BFCL, τ-bench, xLAM, and ToolACE covering 400+ domains

🏆 Gemini-2.0-flash leads the pack with 0.938 score, followed by GPT-4o at 0.900

🚀 Open models are catching up - mistral-small-2501 achieves 0.832

🚫 Some models like DeepSeek excluded due to limited function calling support

📌 Monthly updates planned to keep pace with new model releases

<h1> News 7 </h1>
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered search engine Perplexity AI is planning on launching its own web browser.

The company said in a post on X on Monday (Feb. 24) that the browser, dubbed Comet, was “coming soon,” and invited people to sign up on a waitlist in a reply.

“Just like Perplexity reinvented search, we’re also reinventing the browser,” a Perplexity spokesperson told TechCrunch via email, the publication reported on Monday. “Stay tuned for updates.”

The company said in October that its search engine served over 100 million queries per week.

“Perplexity now serves over 100M queries every week,” Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas wrote in a post on X at the time. “Next stop: 100M+ queries every day.”

In December, Perplexity reportedly closed a $500 million funding round, tripling the startup’s valuation to $9 billion, according to a PYMNTS rerpot. The company’s backers included SoftBank, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the report. Perplexity had a valuation of $520 million early in 2024. During that summer, it was valued at $3 billion.

In November, the company introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant for U.S. consumers.

Through Buy With Pro, shoppers can research and purchase products, Perplexity said in a Nov. 18 blog post.

“It marks a big leap forward in how we serve our users — empowering seamless native actions right from an answer,” the company said in the post. “Shopping online just got 10x more easy and fun.”

The feature is only available to Perplexity Pro users in the U.S. It lets users check out on the company’s website or app for select products from select merchants, according to the post. Consumers who save their shipping and billing information on the portal can use a one-click checkout option.

Additionally, Perplexity unveiled a visual search tool called Snap to Shop, which helps consumers find an item by uploading a photo. Snap to Shop will display relevant products based on the photo, with no need for a product description or name, according to the post.

In other search engine news, a recent Bank of America Global Research report found that global daily visits to Google search are “stable” despite the surge in the number of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity and Claude.

In January, the global average daily visits to Google were up 1% to 2.7 billion from December and down just 1% year over year, according to the report. The daily visits include desktop and mobile searches.

Google’s continued search engine dominance comes as AI chatbots continue to grow in popularity. Last month, visits to ChatGPT were up 4% month over month and 148% year over year to 128 million globally.

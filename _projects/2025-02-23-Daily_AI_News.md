<h1> 30th March 2025 </h1>

<h1> Robinhood is going all in on AI to change the future of investing 😳   </h1>

FinTech giant just dropped Cortex, its new AI-powered investing tool.

Think of Cortex as your personal Wall Street AI analyst - but in your pocket, 24/7.

Here's why Cortex is set to disrupt investing:

💡 Real-Time AI Insights:

↳ Get instant clarity on why stocks move - no noise, just data-driven insights.

📈 Personalized AI Strategies:

↳Cortex doesn't just give generic advice. It tailors recommendations to YOUR goals, YOUR risk appetite, and YOUR trading habits.

💸 AI-Powered Trade Builder:

↳ Turn predictions into precision with AI-crafted trade recommendations, especially impactful for options trading.

🤖 Built on Pluto Capital's Cutting-Edge AI:

↳ Robinhood partnered with AI investment experts Pluto Capital to ensure Cortex offers truly institutional-grade insights.

But here’s the twist:

✅ What Cortex Does:

- Empowers you with pro-level insights, usually reserved for institutional investors.

❌ What Cortex Doesn’t Do:

- It WON’T execute trades automatically - keeping YOU in control.

AI investing is the future, and Robinhood just took a massive leap forward.

Paradigm shift.

<h1>  Presenting The Office x Studio Ghibli. </h1>

This is awesome! Presenting The Office x Studio Ghibli. 100% made with AI 😳

Here's how you can make this yourself in just 3 easy steps:

Step 1: Take a screengrab frame from a video and ask OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o to Ghibli-fy it.

Step 2: Download the audio of the person talking using Cobalt.

Step 3: Upload the Ghibli photo and the audio to Hedra, which does the lip sync and animation.

The crazy part?

Just 2 years ago, this required several dreambooth finetunes, filming the performance, doing style transfers frame by frame, and using some nifty post-processing to remove flickering.

Now, you can do it in minutes using just a few tools.

AI will change creativity forever.

<h1> JPMorgan just changed quantum computing 😳 </h1>

Quantum computers can now create certified TRUE randomness.

Let's break this down:

True randomness = unbreakable security 🔒

Traditional encryption relies on numbers that can eventually be predicted.

Quantum-certified randomness means:

- Unhackable crypto transactions

- Tamper-proof elections

- Truly fair online games

- Bulletproof financial security

And JPMorgan just achieved that.

Of course, they didn’t do it alone. JPM teamed up with Quantinuum, Argonne & Oak Ridge Labs, and UT Austin.

Using a 56-qubit quantum machine, they produced and certified randomness - something impossible before.

And this is BIGGER than finance.

In the digital & AI age, it's all about trust.

Now imagine:

↳ Banks you can actually trust

↳ Lotteries proven fair

↳ Crypto that can't be hacked

Welcome to the future of security. Thanks to quantum tech, which is no longer just a cool theory.

I expect a quantum arms race among banks soon.

And JPMorgan just set the new standard.

<h1> ⚛️Generative AI Meets Molecular Biology: A Game-Changer for Education </h1>

Imagine generating a fully functional 3D model of a key biological enzyme—ATP synthase—using just natural language prompts. This is no longer science fiction; it’s happening now with tools like ManusAI.

Key Points:

1️⃣Natural Language Processing: Describing ATP synthase in layman's terms yields an accurate 3D representation, making complex biology accessible

2️⃣Real-Time Animation Capabilities: With its seamless integration with Blender, Manus AI generates real-time animations that illustrate dynamic processes

3️⃣Cross-Disciplinary Applications: Beyond biology, Manus AI can be applied in physics (visualizing forces), engineering (modeling structures), and even mathematics (illustrating complex equations)

Generative AI is not just advancing technology; it’s transforming education by making the invisible visible and the complex comprehensible. ]

What other complex and abstract concepts can be better taught using AI-enhanced visualizations?

<h1> Elon Musk just made his boldest move yet 😳</h1>

xAI has officially acquired X (formerly Twitter) for $33 billion.

The combination values his AI startup xAI at $80B and X at $33B ($45B less $12B debt). 

Here’s why this matters - and what could happen next:

💸 Data is Power

↳ xAI now controls X’s massive real-time data stream. Expect next-level AI advancements from Grok and beyond (Tesla?).

💸 Strategically, it's Genius

↳ Both companies were already tightly integrated. This merger breaks down barriers and turbocharges innovation, especially in all things social + AI.

💸 Financial Comeback

↳ X’s valuation at $33B is a comeback signal. This indicates that advertisers and investors are probably jumping back onboard.

💸 Privacy Concerns

↳ Privacy concerns are more important than ever before. Will users trust Musk’s AI with their data? Transparency will make or break this deal.

💸 A Wake-Up Call for Competitors

↳ OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and DeepSeek should be watching this very closely. Apart from Meta, nobody else can offer seamless AI & social media integration. Maybe we'll see a wave of AI-social media mergers?

What's next?

- Smarter AI-driven features on X (think hyper-targeted ads and personalized feeds).

- Regulatory battles ahead - antitrust and privacy scrutiny incoming. Especially in Europe.

This merger isn’t just business - it’s Musk reshaping tech, society, AI, and how we interact online.

Again.

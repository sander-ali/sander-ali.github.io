Research Activity:

The nominee has published over 80+ articles in top-tier publication venues, which include IEEE Transactions, Elsevier, and Springer. The nominee has also published articles in flagship conferences including IEEE WCNC, IEEE ICC, and IEEE Globecom.

Key Contributions:
 
- The nominee proposed the study “Contextual Healthcare Internet of Things Services, and People” which has been fundamental in developing IoT systems for ubiquitous healthcare services, and Internet of Everything.
 
- The nominee proposed the study “Hybrid and hierarchical fusion networks: a deep cross-modal learning architecture for action recognition” which was the first time a cross modal learning architecture to develop six stream networks was proposed. 

- The nominee proposed the study “VIRFIM: an AI and Internet of Medical Things-driven framework for healthcare using smart sensors” that proposed a generalized framework that uses wearable sensors and devices in order to follow good practices to cope with the global pandemics such as COVID. 

- The nominee proposed the study “Toward industrial private AI: A two-tier framework for data and model security” that highlighted the issue of model privacy attacks for the first time in the context of communication networks. Since then, the authors’ collaborative network has published more than 10 articles for the defense against model privacy attacks. 

- The nominee proposed the study “Chatgpt needs spade (sustainability, privacy, digital divide, and ethics) evaluation: A review”, which has gained a lot of attention from the research community as it highlights sustainable and ethical concerns in LLMs. 

- The nominee has also been working collaboratively with researchers in academics and industries from various parts of the world including UK, Spain, Pakistan, India, South Korea, USA, Italy, and More. 

- The nominee has won CVPR UG2+ competition as a first and second runner-up in 2022 and 2023. IEEE CVPR is the most prestigious venue for computer science researchers. 

- The nominee has been included in the top 10 teams for various competitions in CVPR from 2022 – 2024. 

- The nominee has supervised (ing) more than 12 master’s students and graduated 1 Ph.D. student from universities in Ireland, Pakistan, and Malaysia.

- The nominee was a founding chairman/incharge of the Department of Telecommunication Engineering at University of Sindh, Pakistan.
 
- The nominee has collaborated with nearby computing for research collaboration.

- The nominee is an academic editor in PLOS ONE journal and has served as guest editors in various top-tier journals. 


Research Outputs:


As mentioned, the nominee has published over 80+ articles. Amongst them, the nominee has published article in International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), which is considered to be a premiere venue for the researchers in the field of Computer Vision. The study proposed semantic image networks for human action recognition from videos where authors proposed a novel segmentation method along with a novel network architecture for achieving state-of-the-art results for human action recognition from videos.
 
The nominee has published various articles in IEEE Transactions including IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, and more, which are considered to be the top-most venues and publication Journals. 

The author published the work “Toward industrial private AI: A two-tier framework for data and model security”, which has significantly contributed to the body of science in terms of Model inversion and poisoning attacks. As of present, we (as a collaborative team) are one of the leading research groups that consistently work on the design and defense for model inversion, model poisoning and membership inference attacks for vehicular and communication systems. So far, our works on this topic has been published in IEEE Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering, IEEE International Conference on Communications, IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, IEEE Global Communications, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics. As an author, the nominee has also won two best paper awards, amongst them one was on the model privacy topic at IEEE WCNC conference. 

Every year, the nominee participates in IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) associated conference challenges such as NTIRE, PBVS, UG2+, that are centered around image restoration methods, which are faced with real-world challenges. From 2022 – 2024, the nominee has been included in Top 10 teams for various competitions and has been included in five of their challenge reports, which are considered to be benchmark for the respective application domains. 

The nominee is also very active in developing web-based applications using emerging technologies, which are available on his hugging face spaces, which include the design of image captioning, image denoising, image inpainting, image generation, and chatbot systems for health disease prevention applications. The vision-based applications mentioned above heavily leverage the large language models, and best performing vision models, accordingly.

Impact and Recognition

Following are the examples:

- Best Paper award at IEEE WCNC 2024. 

- Inclusion in Top 10 teams for the challenge NTIRE Blind Compressed Image Enhancement Challenge at CVPR 2024. Also included in their challenge report, which is published in CVPR workshops.

- Invited as a guest at Eye Off Data Summit for Privacy Preservation Machine Learning.

- First and Second Runner Up positions in UG2+ Atmospheric Turbulence and Mitigation Challenge for 2022 – 2023. 

- So far, the nominee has published Five journal articles in 2024 in top-tier publication venues. One of them is published in IEEE Communication Surveys and Tutorials, which is the top-most publication venue in the field having an impact factor of 34.6

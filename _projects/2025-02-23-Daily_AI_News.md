<h1> 19th March 2025 </h1>

<h1> AI workloads are exploding. </h1>

Here's why it's a game-changer for FinTech:

Cloud spending will hit a whopping $1.6 trillion by 2028 üò≥

Gartner warns that 32% of that spend is pure waste.

Let that sink in.

Every wasted dollar isn't just lost money - it's wasted energy, needless hardware, and a direct hit to our planet.

More importantly, the environmental cost of unchecked cloud spend is staggering:

- Excessive power usage

- Unnecessary hardware

- Hidden sustainability impacts

But there's hope.

Meet the unsung heroes: FinOps professionals.

They're quietly saving the environment - turning off one NVIDIA H100 GPU at a time (even though Jensen Huang might not like it!).

Today, I just came across an exciting new open-source, no-code FinOps automation platform OpenOps.

Imagine democratized, effortless cloud efficiency - available to everyone.

Now you can. Thanks to OpenOps:

- You can now download, use & deploy their software for free
- Access a curated list of tons of workflow templates & more!

The future of tech is open source.

<h1> RIP Adobe Photoshop? </h1>

Google‚Äôs latest AI model Gemini Flash 2.0 Experimental with image generation and editing is absolutely insane üò≥

Most people can‚Äôt do those actions on Photoshop but absolutely everyone can write a sentence in Google AI Studio.

The crazy part?

Flash 2.0 did everything in 6 seconds.

The future of image editing is text.

Incredible.

<h1>Real Time Speech Transcription with FastRTC ‚ö°Ô∏èand Local Whisper ü§ó </h1>

Real-time Whisper transcriptions w/ FastRTC & Transformers - runs on MPS (Mac) and CUDA - open source üî•

- Choose the ASR model you want to use: `whisper-large-v3-turbo` is my current favourite as it‚Äôs lightweight, performant and multilingual!

- Optionally enable `flash_attention_2` for faster attention computations, if your setup supports it

- Launch the app via Gradio, or as a FastAPI server with custom UI

- Let FastRTC take care of all the real-time interactions! And explore the docs to understand what you can tweak to have more control over your Stream

Check it out here: https://github.com/sofi444/realtime-transcription-fastrtc

Stellar work by Sofia C.

<h1> News from MetaVoice  </h1>

We‚Äôre releasing access to Speech-1, our conversational speech model designed specifically for customer phone calls (8khz telephony) to reduce call drop rates.

Try it: https://tts.metavoice.io

Samples: https://www.metavoice.io

Voice AI calls today face >30% call drop rates with current synthetic voices. We want to make this tend to 0 by making AI speech far more human-like and engaging.

Current synthetic voices are overly perfect, and don‚Äôt sound like the typical human phone agent. They have audiobook-like narration, erratic emotions (e.g. over-enthusiastic ‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù), and lack natural-sounding imperfections (like breaths, hmm, umm). They also can‚Äôt reliably speak numbers, spellings, emails, etc. (& often produce chipmunk like sped-up speech).

Speech-1 fixes these problems!

We‚Äôre also releasing a research preview of Speech-1.1. It‚Äôs trained using ProsodyAlign, a novel post-training technique to more closely capture human-like speech patterns ‚Äì pauses, stress, and how the voice goes up/down in tone on different words. However, it is currently less stable than Speech-1.

For more details, read our blogpost: https://www.metavoice.io/blog-posts/conversational-speech-model

<h1> AI isn‚Äôt killing programming jobs - it's reinventing them. </h1>

Rumors that AI will erase computer programmers are greatly exaggerated.

The truth is far more interesting.

Programmers aren't disappearing - they're transforming.

The chart below brilliantly proves it:

‚Ü≥ Computer programmers: Declining since the '90s üìâ

‚Ü≥ Software developers: Explosive growth since the 2000s üöÄ

Here's why:

AI and automation are taking over the repetitive grind.

- Routine coding

- Basic debugging

- Tedious testing

What remains - and expands - is more valuable:

- Strategic thinking

- System design

- Innovative solutions

The job market agrees:

Software developer roles are projected to surge by 17% by 2033.

But there's a catch:

Routine programming tasks might face up to 80% automation by 2032.
All thanks to AI.

Your next move is, therefore:

‚Ü≥ Developers: Master AI. Keep upgrading your skills. Your role isn't disappearing - it's upgrading.

‚Ü≥ Businesses: Integrate AI, but invest heavily in human talent. Balance tech with creativity.

‚Ü≥ Educators: Focus on teaching AI, critical thinking, and ethical tech use. Prepare students to lead, not just code.

AI isn't replacing programmers - it's redefining their potential.

Master AI and you will thrive in this new era.

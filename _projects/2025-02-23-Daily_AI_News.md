<h1> OpenAI announces GPT 4.5 </h1>

BREAKING: OpenAI announces GPT-4.5

Here's everything you need to know:

- OpenAI: "GPT-4.5 is our largest and most knowledgeable model yet."

- Available as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users and developers in the API.

- Coming to Plus users and others starting next week.

- GPT-4.5 is the next step in scaling unsupervised learning. It increases world knowledge, improves intuition, and reduces hallucination.

- The model doesn't support native reasoning (step-by-step) capabilities but it's generally useful and inherently smarter.

- The team is still experimenting and researching emerging capabilities of this type of scaling. But this is the best chat model yet according to OpenAI folks for tasks requiring deeper knowledge and advanced context understanding.

- GPT-4.5 is useful for improving writing, programming, and practical problem-solving. 

- GPT-4.5 is better at understanding human needs and intent. Trained with data derived from smaller models. Conversations should feel warmer, more intuitive, and emotionally nuanced. The hallucination rate is lower than in other models.

- Human evaluations were done and results demonstrate improvements in creative intelligence and how warm the tone of the GPT-4.5 model is.

- The model was post-trained using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. Trained across multiple data centers that required huge amounts of computing resources. Apparently, GPT-4.5 used 10X more pretraining compute than GPT4.

- GPT-4.5 also integrates with other tools like file upload, images, canvas, and search. GPT-4.5 is available to all developers via the API on all paid tiers. It has function calling, structured outputs, streaming, image inputs, and more.

- On the future: reasoning is a core capability, unsupervised learning and reasoning compliment each other, and gpt-4.5 will serve as a strong foundation for future reasoning models and agents.

Price per 1M tokens:

- $75 for input
- $150 for output
- $37.50 for cached input

The knowledge cutoff for GPT-4.5 is October 2023. 

- Context window: 128,000 tokens
- Max output tokens: 16,384 tokens

<h1>Zep AI introduces Graphiti</h1>

Zep AI introduces you to Graphiti, an open-source Temporal Knowledge Graph framework that gives AI agents the ability to learn and retain information over time, just like humans do. ü§ñ


Graphiti was inspired by Microsoft GraphRAG, but has a key architectural difference: It understands how newly ingested data might change existing data, and is purpose built for data that evolves over time.


Why does this matter? Imagine you tell a food delivery app that you've adopted veganism, but it keeps recommending your once-favorite burger joint. Or picture a sales assistant that forgets a key client's purchasing history and constraints, resulting in tone-deaf product pitches. That's the kind of experience that frustrates users and undermines trust in AI.


With Graphiti, AI agents can reason with evolving data, enabling more personalized, context-aware interactions. Whether you're building a chatbot, LLM-powered assistant, or a next-gen AI system, Graphiti provides the foundation for fast, accurate long-term memory.


We've implemented Graphiti in Zep, our memory layer for enterprise AI agents, and wrote a paper on how Zep and Graphiti perform versus other approaches to agent memory (it's the State of the Art!).

<h1> Arize Pheonix </h1>

Trace & Evaluate your Agent with Arize Phoenix

So, you‚Äôve built your agent. It takes in inputs and tools, processes them, and generates responses. Maybe it‚Äôs making decisions, retrieving information, executing tasks autonomously, or all three. But now comes the big question ‚Äì how effectively is it performing? And more importantly, how do you know?

Building an agent is one thing; understanding its behavior is another. That‚Äôs where tracing and evaluations come in. Tracing allows you to see exactly what your agent is doing step by step‚Äîwhat inputs it receives, how it processes information, and how it arrives at its final output. Think of it like having an X-ray for your agent‚Äôs decision-making process.
 
Meanwhile, evaluation helps you measure performance, ensuring your agent isn‚Äôt just functional, but actually effective. Is it producing the right answers? How relevant are its findings at each step? How well-crafted is the agent‚Äôs response? Does it align with your goals?

Arize Phoenix provides a centralized platform to trace, evaluate, and debug your agent's decisions in real time‚Äîall in one place. We‚Äôll dive into how you can implement them to refine and optimize your agent. Because building is just the beginning‚Äîtrue intelligence comes from knowing exactly what‚Äôs happening under the hood.

<h1> Mercury Coder </h1>

üî• Try the worlds fast coding system. Released earlier today, Mercury Coder represents a major breakthrough in high speed/performance coding models. 

This newly announced language diffusion model recently achieved an impressive ranking of #2 in the Copilot Arena while reaching a throughput of 1,000 tokens per second on high end H100s. 

Apparently it‚Äôs been independently verified and it‚Äôs performance rates exceeding 700 tokens per second. 

A language diffusion model is a generative approach that starts with random noise and iteratively refines it to produce coherent text, similar to how image diffusion models generate detailed visuals. 

Unlike traditional autoregressive methods, this approach leverages a denoising process that gradually transforms randomness into structured language or this case functional code, massively boosting efficiency and scalability.

It’s a hybrid reasoning model, producing near-instant responses or extended, step-by-step thinking. One model, two ways to think.</p> <p>Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a significant upgrade over its predecessor. In extended thinking mode, it self-reflects before answering, which improves its performance on math, physics, instruction-following, coding, and many other tasks.</p> <p>We generally find that prompting for the model works similarly in both modes. API users also have fine-grained control over how long the model can think for.</p> <p>Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a state-of-the-art model for coding and agentic tool use. However, in developing it, we optimized less for math and computer science competition problems, and more for real-world tasks. We believe this more closely reflects the needs of our customers.</p> <p>We conducted extensive model testing for safety, security, and reliability. We also listened to your feedback. With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, we’ve reduced unnecessary refusals of requests by 45% compared to its predecessor.</p> <p>Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code mark an important step towards AI systems that can truly augment human capabilities.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing what you’ll create. And we welcome your feedback as we continue to build. https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet</p> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"> <div class="pswp-gallery pswp-gallery--single-column" id="gallery--news" style="display: flex; gap: 10px; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;"> <a href="/assets/img/news/AI%20news/5.jpg" data-pswp-width="1200" data-pswp-height="800" target="_blank"> <img src="/assets/img/news/AI%20news/5.jpg" alt="Google Gemini 2.0" style="width: 640px; height: 480px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;"> </a> </div> </div> <h1> News 6 </h1> <p>New Agent/Function Calling Leaderboard from Galileo evaluates 17 LLMs across 14 benchmarks.

The company’s backers included SoftBank, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the report. Perplexity had a valuation of $520 million early in 2024. During that summer, it was valued at $3 billion.</p> <p>In November, the company introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant for U.S. consumers.</p> <p>Through Buy With Pro, shoppers can research and purchase products, Perplexity said in a Nov. 18 blog post.</p> <p>“It marks a big leap forward in how we serve our users — empowering seamless native actions right from an answer,” the company said in the post. “Shopping online just got 10x more easy and fun.”</p> <p>The feature is only available to Perplexity Pro users in the U.S. It lets users check out on the company’s website or app for select products from select merchants, according to the post. Consumers who save their shipping and billing information on the portal can use a one-click checkout option.</p> <p>Additionally, Perplexity unveiled a visual search tool called Snap to Shop, which helps consumers find an item by uploading a photo. Snap to Shop will display relevant products based on the photo, with no need for a product description or name, according to the post.</p> <p>In other search engine news, a recent Bank of America Global Research report found that global daily visits to Google search are “stable” despite the surge in the number of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity and Claude.</p> <p>In January, the global average daily visits to Google were up 1% to 2.7 billion from December and down just 1% year over year, according to the report. The daily visits include desktop and mobile searches.</p> <p>Google’s continued search engine dominance comes as AI chatbots continue to grow in popularity. Last month, visits to ChatGPT were up 4% month over month and 148% year over year to 128 million globally.</p> <p>source: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/ntt-data-cdao-c-suite-leaders-have-angst-about-genai-still-go-full-throttle/</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0 text-left"> © Copyright 2025 Sunder Ali Khowaja. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-82147914-4"></script> <script>function gtag(){window.dataLayer.push(arguments)}window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","UA-82147914-4");</script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> <script>for(var wechatModal=document.getElementById("WeChatMod"),wechatBtn=document.querySelectorAll('[id="WeChatBtn"]'),i=0;i<wechatBtn.length;i++)wechatBtn[i].onclick=function(){wechatModal.style.display="block"};window.onclick=function(t){t.target==wechatModal&&(wechatModal.style.display="none")};</script> <script type="module">
